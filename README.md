# Plant Maturity Detection and Potato-Disease-Classification

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Plant Maturity Detection project aims to help farmers optimize harvest timing by analyzing plant images and predicting maturity levels using Machine Learning (ML) models. This assists in improving crop yield, reducing waste, and enhancing agricultural decision-making.

# Key Features
âœ… Automated plant maturity detection based on image inputs
âœ… Preprocessing techniques for noise reduction and feature extraction
âœ… Machine Learning model training for classification
âœ… User-friendly interface for farmers and researchers
âœ… Performance evaluation and accuracy metrics
